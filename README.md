# Detroit-Blight-Violation
A data science/machine learning project to explore the issue of blight violation in the city of Detroit.
The project is based on data from the Detroit Open Data Portal.


The City of Detroit faces a property blight problem. Over 20% of properties in Detroit are affected by blight, 
however less than 10% of the issued tickets paid in full, leaving tens of millions of dollars in unpaid fines.
The City of Detroit collects data on blight violations which is made publicly available on the Detroit Open Data Portal.
This project aims to explore the problem in hopes of discovering insights that may help solve it.
These insights are visualized in a number of graphics showing the correlation between various features of the violations 
and compliance with the issued tickets. 
A decision tree classifier is trained and evaluated. This machine learning model is chosen for its interpretability.
The trained decision tree is represented in a graphic which can be studied to further explore the issue.

The data used is available at: https://data.detroitmi.gov/Property-Parcels/Blight-Violations/ti6p-wcg4/data

The '.ipynb' file can be opened and run with Jupyter Notebook, and the '.py' file contains the code in regular text format.

The 'Graphics and Visualizations' folder includes all the visualizations, most in png format.
